### Rental Cash Flow Analysis
A small script that takes in basic financial data from a user regarding 
the purchase and rental of a residental property. It returns simple return on investment metrics
including gross return, cap rate, and cash on cash. The script also calculates amortization tables.

This was my first foray into using classes.
